# EveTimezone
A utility to visualize the active timezone of an entity in Eve Online using the zKillboard API.

An online version is hosted here: http://miningop.com/evetimezone/

## Development

To compile this app you will need the following:
* Node.js (use a recent version for your own sanity, should also be compatible with io.js)
* Npm (whichever version goes with your version of node.js above)
* Bower

### Installation

Once you have Node and npm installed (the installation of which are out of the scope of this readme), installation is simple:

```
$> npm install

$> bower install

$> grunt
```

This should create the required bundled js file in the correct path, and you should be able to open index.html in your favorite browser.
